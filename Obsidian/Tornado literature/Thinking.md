1. Using the ensemble experiment to find out the difference between tornadoes and non-tornadoes, especially the buoyancy field and dynamic lifting
2. Why after 0700 UTC, the tornado can maintain such long? Before 0700 UTC, the surface vertical vorticity has already existed, but cannot maintain and soon weaken. 
	A: The vertical acceleration is not strong, therefore the vertical velocity is not strong enough to draw the air from bottom to higher altitudes.
	- The trendency of vertical velocity *w* is similar to that of vertical vorticity. 
	- ==Can we say that the our study conform as [[Tornado literature Review#^90b1ae | tornadogesis depends on vertical stretching]] ==?

    3. Which process (dynamic lifting or buoyancy) play in the intensification of tornado? 
    If [[buoyancy]], how does effective buoyancy change? If [[dynamic lifting]], does dynamic VPPGF increase?
    - dynamic lifting: the concerned parameters, such as SRH?
