- The importance of stretching:
1. [Flournoy et al. 2020](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/MWR-D-20-0147.1).  The deciding condition for tornadogenesis is not whether surface vertical vorticity exists, ==but is how the vorticity modified by supercells== ^90b1ae

- the best discriminators between tornadic and nontornadic supercells ( In nontornadic supercells, it appears that the low-level updraft fails to draw air upward far from the surface (e.g., [Markowski and Richardson 2014](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/148/10/mwrD200147.xml#bib41); [Coffer and Parker 2017](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/148/10/mwrD200147.xml#bib9)), suggesting the presence of a weaker or less steady low-level updraft and/or more negatively buoyant outflow, cited by [Flournoy et al. 2020](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/MWR-D-20-0147.1).  )
	- Buoyancy and dynamic lifting are both important
	1. [Thompson et al. 2003](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/54/2/jamc-d-14-0171.1.xml#bib60). lower (higher) LCL height and larger (smaller) 0–1-km SRH
		*explanation: Lower LCL heights are associated with less evaporation of rain in an RFD and more positively buoyant RFD outflow air. +Higher 0–1-km SRH is likely related to larger upward-directed VPPGFs and more stretching of existing vertical vorticity.*
	2. [[[Yokota et al. (2018)]](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/MWR-D-17-0254.1). 
		*The results showed that two near-tornado mesoscale factors were important for tornadogenesis: strong low-level mesocyclones (LMCs) at about 1 km above ground level and humid air near the surface. Strong LMCs and large water vapor near the surface strengthened the nonlinear dynamic vertical perturbation pressure gradient force and buoyancy, respectively*.

	- Only dynamic lifting is important
	1. [Flournoy et al. 2020](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/MWR-D-20-0147.1).  
		- *The difference between tornado and non-tornadoes is the intensity of dynamic lift. The ensemble of tornado cases has more strong low-level mesocyclone.*
		- *however, the tempetature deficits in both ensembles (tonadic and nontornadic supercells) in this study are consistent with those observed in the outflow of tornadic supercells*
	2. [Coffer et al. 2017](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/MWR-D-17-0152.1)and [Coffer and Parker (2017)](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/MWR-D-16-0226.1). 
		*The difference in tornado production between the simulated storms was mostly attributed to variations in rotation-induced dynamic lift, with storms initialized in the ==tornadic environment== containing ==stronger low-level updrafts ==than those in the nontornadic environment. This difference was related to variations in the environmental low-level wind profile in both environments; while both contained similar effective SRH, the tornadic environment was characterized by ==more streamwise horizontal vorticity ==(and SRH) in the lowest 500 m AGL than the nontornadic environment*.

	- Only buoyancy is important
	1.  [Kumjian and Ryzhkov (2008a)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/54/2/jamc-d-14-0171.1.xml#bib27) (this paper only focused on buoyancy, the role of dynamic lifing does not include, therefore it falls into this category)
		*it was suggested that nontornadic hook echoes may have greater median _Z_DR and more large-drop gates than do tornadic hook echoes because of greater rates of evaporation in the attendant storm RFD*
	2. [Frentch et al. 2015]([https://doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0171.1](https://doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0171.1)). tornadic cases generally have lower mean/median _Z_DR for a given _Z__H_ than do the nontornadic cases.
		*higher boundary layer relative humidity leads to less evaporative cooling within storm-scale downdrafts, resulting in relatively warmer outflow compared to downdrafts experiencing more evaporative cooling*
	3. [Peters et al. 2019](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/76/10/jas-d-19-0096.1.xml). 
		 *Analyses of the vertical momentum forcing along trajectories shows that maximum vertical velocities are often enhanced by dynamic pressure accelerations, but this enhancement is accompanied by larger downward buoyant pressure accelerations than in ordinary convection. Integrated buoyancy along parcel paths is therefore a strong constraint on maximum updraft speeds. Thus, through a combination of processes consistent with the dynamic and thermodynamic hypotheses, supercell updrafts are able to realize a larger percentage of CAPE than ordinary updrafts.*
	 
	4. #need_to_conform (*may have some connections with buoyancy*) ：Storm outflow temperature is related to boundary layer relative humidity in the environment within which the storm resides. e.g., [Rasmussen and Blanchard 1998](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/148/10/mwrD200147.xml#bib62); [Rasmussen 2003](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/148/10/mwrD200147.xml#bib61); [Markowski et al. 2003](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/148/10/mwrD200147.xml#bib46); [Thompson et al. 2003](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/148/10/mwrD200147.xml#bib75); [Craven and Brooks 2004](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/148/10/mwrD200147.xml#bib14); [Markowski and Richardson 2009](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/148/10/mwrD200147.xml#bib39)

	*the parameter-space distributions of warnings and events are similar; at least in a broad sense, there is no systematic problem with forecasting that explains the high overall false alarm ratio, which instead seems to stem from the inability to know which storms in a given environment will be tornadic.*
