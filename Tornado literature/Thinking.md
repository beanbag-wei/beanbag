- [I] Using the ensemble experiment to find out the difference between tornadoes and non-tornadoes, especially the buoyancy field and dynamic lifting
	- statistical method, calculating the correlation coefficients between the concerned paramters such as SRH, humidity, temperature and low-level mesocyclone?

1. Why after 0700 UTC, the tornado can maintain such long? Before 0700 UTC, the surface vertical vorticity has already existed, but cannot maintain and soon weaken. 
	*A: The vertical acceleration is not strong, therefore the vertical velocity is not strong enough to draw the air from bottom to higher altitudes.*
	- The trendency of vertical velocity *w* is similar to that of vertical vorticity. 
	- ==Can we say that the our study conform as [[Tornado literature Review#^90b1ae | tornadogesis depends on vertical stretching]] ==?

    3. Which process (dynamic lifting or buoyancy) play in the intensification of tornado? 
    If [[buoyancy]], how does effective buoyancy change? If [[dynamic lifting]], does dynamic VPPGF increase?
    - The potential temperature does not increase prominently as time goes by.
    - dynamic lifting: how to explain the increase of splatting term. May because of increase of wind shear.
		 - [/] calculate each convergence term and shear term according to formula.
		 - [ ] draw different components of splatting term, including normal-x, normal-y, normal-z, shear-x, shear-y, and shear-z terms. 
    -  There exist a transition at about 5590, before 5590, spinning term is positive, splatting term is negative, while from 5590, spinning term is negative and spaltting term is positive. 
		 - [/] vorticity may change at this time, need to substantiate. 
		 *the picture pgfspn is overlaied with maximum vorticity in each level and labelled their value to explain the distribution of pgfspn and the transition at 5590*
		 - [?] But why does splatting term change too?
    - effective buoyancy always positive, but is small compared to dynamic lifting
    
    4. Why does the distribution of dynamic VPPGF like a dipole?
